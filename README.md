BootWill
==============

An .SCSS-based framework for generating responsive styles for your content
--------------

By adding new values to the array **$sizes** at the top of *bootwill.scss* then compiling the document, you can generate new responsive width assignments with minimal effort. Breakpoints for tablets and smartphones included! You can also adjust the margin by changing the **$margin** variable, just make sure it isn't higher than half of your smallest size or it will result in elements with 0 width.
